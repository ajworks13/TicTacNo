Hello everyone!
The game is like Tic Tac Toe but with a twist of Chance. All you do is click on the black box at the bottom and watch how much you roll for your turn. It is not complete, but it is playable. There are some things I would like to add like restarting, name tags, more animations, etc.. but I am going to leave it here for now. I must continue onto other projects.

Another thing to note is the combinations that I have added when rolling might not be completed. But I managed to add enough to make the game playable. I hope you guys like it.
